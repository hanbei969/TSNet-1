# TSNet

A New Method for Constructing Tumor Specific Gene Co-Expression Networks Based on Samples with Tumor Purity Heterogeneity 
 
To check how TSNet works run file R/TSNet_Estimation_Example.R which

    1) Generates Synthetic Data as in section 3 of [1]
    2) Estimates Tumor Purity
    3) Estimates Co-expression networks for the tumor and non-tumor components for a given value of penalty parameters
